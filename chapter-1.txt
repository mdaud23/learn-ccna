Some tips to take the Cisco Exam

== Chapter 1: Internetworking ==
  Internetwork := you create an internetwork when you connect two or more networks via a router and configure a logical network addressing scheme with a protocol such as IP or IPv6

Imagine network as a neighborhood with its rule of street and way. There are some block or segmentation also. 
  Hub doesn't have mind, switch does

Terlalu banyak broadcast/multicast gitu dapat mengakibatkan LAN traffic congestion

Hubs don't segment the network; they just connect network segments. Routers are basically employed to efficiently break up a broadcast domain

Routers create internetwork

we don’t use layer 2 switches to create internetworks because they don’t break up broadcast domains by default. Jadi, si switch teh cuma digunakan dalam lingkup LAN saja

Okay, so by default, switches break up collision domains, but what are these things? Collision
domain is an Ethernet term used to describe a network scenario in which one device sends a
packet out on a network segment and every other device on that same segment is forced to pay
attention no matter what. This isn’t very efficient because if a different device tries to transmit at
the same time, a collision will occur, requiring both devices to retransmit, one at a time—not
good! This happens a lot in a hub environment, where each host segment connects to a hub that
represents only one collision domain and a single broadcast domain. By contrast, each and every
port on a switch represents its own collision domain, allowing network traffic to flow much more
smoothly.

Still, clearly the best network design is the one that’s perfectly configured to meet the business
requirements of the specific company or client it serves, and it’s usually one in which LAN
switches exist in harmony with routers strategically placed in the network

Ada istilah collision domain dan broadcast domain. collision tuh dari satu point ke point lainnya (kalo bolak balik sama ga diitun). Eh entahlah masih ga jelas wkwkk

saat buku dibuat, switch 10 Gbps itu minimum
