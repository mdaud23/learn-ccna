== Chapter 3: Introduction to TCP/IP ==

It may be counterintuitive, but most of the development work on TCP/IP happened at UC
Berkeley in Northern California, where a group of scientists were simultaneously working on the
Berkeley version of UNIX, which soon became known as the Berkeley Software Distribution
(BSD) series of UNIX versions.

= TCP/IP and DoD Model =

The DoD model is basically a condensed version of the OSI model that comprises four instead of
seven layers:
- Process / Application Layer
- Host-to-Host layer or Transport Layer
- Internet Layer
- Network Access layer or Link layer

the Process/Application
layer defines protocols for node-to-node application communication and controls user-interface
specifications.

The Host-to-Host layer or Transport layer parallels the functions of the OSI’s Transport layer,
defining protocols for setting up the level of transmission service for applications. It tackles
issues like creating reliable end-to-end communication and ensuring the error-free delivery of
data. It handles packet sequencing and maintains data integrity.

The Internet layer corresponds to the OSI’s Network layer, designating the protocols relating to
the logical transmission of packets over the entire network. It takes care of the addressing of
hosts by giving them an IP (Internet Protocol) address and handles the routing of packets among
multiple networks.

At the bottom of the DoD model, the Network Access layer or Link layer implements the data
exchange between the host and the network. The equivalent of the Data Link and Physical layers
of the OSI model, the Network Access layer oversees hardware addressing and defines protocols
for the physical transmission of data. The reason TCP/IP became so popular is because there
were no set physical layer specifications, so it could run on any existing or future physical
network!

Kan ada DoD model ya... nah TCP/IP protocol suite tuh ada di setiap layer DoD

telnet teh kayak windows viewer yak, tapi windows viewer pake UDP
SSH tau lah ya buat apa
FTP untuk transfer file, bisa kasih tau informasi directory juga. FTP dipake kalo mau transfer big size of file
SNMP untuk collect network information dari Network Management Station (NMS)
HTTP tau ya, tapi ini protokol lhoo
HTTPS 
Network Time Protocol synchronize the clocks on our computers to one standard time source (typically, an atomic clock)

DNS resolve hostname to IP address
An IP address identifies hosts on a network and the Internet as well, but DNS was designed to
make our lives easier. Think about this: What would happen if you wanted to move your web
page to a different service provider?

= DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) =
It assigns IP address to host
It allows for easier
administration and works well in small to very large network environments. Many types of
hardware can be used as a DHCP server, including a Cisco router.

A client that sends out a DHCP Discover message in order to receive an IP address sends out a
broadcast at both layer 2 and layer 3.
The layer 2 broadcast is all Fs in hex, which looks like this: ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff.
The layer 3 broadcast is 255.255.255.255, which means all networks and all hosts.

DHCP client four step process:
1. The DHCP client broadcasts a DHCP Discover message looking for a DHCP server (Port 67).
2. The DHCP server that received the DHCP Discover message sends a layer 2 unicast DHCP
Offer message back to the host.
3. The client then broadcasts to the server a DHCP Request message asking for the offered IP
address and possibly other information.
4. The server finalizes the exchange with a unicast DHCP Acknowledgment message.

The main purpose of the Host-to-Host layer is to shield the upper-layer applications from the
complexities of the network. This layer says to the upper layer, “Just give me your data stream,
with any instructions, and I’ll begin the process of getting your information ready to send.”

= Transmission Control Protocol =
Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) takes large blocks of information from an application and
breaks them into segments. It numbers and sequences each segment so that the destination’s TCP
stack can put the segments back into the order the application intended

TCP is a full-duplex, connection-oriented, reliable, and accurate protocol, but establishing all
these terms and conditions, in addition to error checking, is no small task.

Most programmers use TCP because it removes a lot of programming work, but for real-time
video and VoIP, User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is often better because using it results in less
overhead.

= TCP Segment Format =
Source port 16 digit - Destination port 16 digit

= User Datagram Protocol =
User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is basically the scaled-down economy model of TCP, which is
why UDP is sometimes referred to as a thin protocol. Like a thin person on a park bench, a thin
protocol doesn’t take up a lot of room—or in this case, require much bandwidth on a network.

So clearly, there are times that it’s wise for developers to opt for UDP rather than TCP, one of
them being when reliability is already taken care of at the Process/Application layer. Network
File System (NFS) handles its own reliability issues, making the use of TCP both impractical and
redundant. But ultimately, it’s up to the application developer to opt for using UDP or TCP, not
the user who wants to transfer data faster!

UDP does not sequence the segments and does not care about the order in which the segments
arrive at the destination. UDP just sends the segments off and forgets about them. It doesn’t
follow through, check up on them, or even allow for an acknowledgment of safe arrival—
complete abandonment. Because of this, it’s referred to as an unreliable protocol. This does not
mean that UDP is ineffective, only that it doesn’t deal with reliability issues at all.

= UDP Segment Format =
16 bit source port - 16 bit destination port
16 bit length - 16 bit checksum

= Internet Layer Protocol =

All network roads don’t lead to Rome—they lead to IP.
ada internet protocol
Remember, just as all
roads lead to Rome, all segments or data must go through IP!

= ICMP =
yah ping

= Address Resolution Protocol =
Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) finds the hardware address of a host from a known IP
address.

hardware address—the latter is hard-coded on a
network interface card (NIC) and used for finding hosts on a local network
