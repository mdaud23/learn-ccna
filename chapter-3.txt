== Chapter 3: Introduction to TCP/IP ==

It may be counterintuitive, but most of the development work on TCP/IP happened at UC
Berkeley in Northern California, where a group of scientists were simultaneously working on the
Berkeley version of UNIX, which soon became known as the Berkeley Software Distribution
(BSD) series of UNIX versions.

= TCP/IP and DoD Model =

The DoD model is basically a condensed version of the OSI model that comprises four instead of
seven layers:
- Process / Application Layer
- Host-to-Host layer or Transport Layer
- Internet Layer
- Network Access layer or Link layer

the Process/Application
layer defines protocols for node-to-node application communication and controls user-interface
specifications.

The Host-to-Host layer or Transport layer parallels the functions of the OSI’s Transport layer,
defining protocols for setting up the level of transmission service for applications. It tackles
issues like creating reliable end-to-end communication and ensuring the error-free delivery of
data. It handles packet sequencing and maintains data integrity.

The Internet layer corresponds to the OSI’s Network layer, designating the protocols relating to
the logical transmission of packets over the entire network. It takes care of the addressing of
hosts by giving them an IP (Internet Protocol) address and handles the routing of packets among
multiple networks.

At the bottom of the DoD model, the Network Access layer or Link layer implements the data
exchange between the host and the network. The equivalent of the Data Link and Physical layers
of the OSI model, the Network Access layer oversees hardware addressing and defines protocols
for the physical transmission of data. The reason TCP/IP became so popular is because there
were no set physical layer specifications, so it could run on any existing or future physical
network!

Kan ada DoD model ya... nah TCP/IP protocol suite tuh ada di setiap layer DoD

telnet teh kayak windows viewer yak, tapi windows viewer pake UDP
SSH tau lah ya buat apa
FTP untuk transfer file, bisa kasih tau informasi directory juga. FTP dipake kalo mau transfer big size of file
SNMP untuk collect network information dari Network Management Station (NMS)
HTTP tau ya, tapi ini protokol lhoo
HTTPS 
Network Time Protocol synchronize the clocks on our computers to one standard time source (typically, an atomic clock)

DNS resolve hostname to IP address
An IP address identifies hosts on a network and the Internet as well, but DNS was designed to
make our lives easier. Think about this: What would happen if you wanted to move your web
page to a different service provider?

DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)
