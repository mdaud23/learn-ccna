== Ethernet Networking and Data Encapsulation ==

I really want you to grasp the big picture of LANs conceptually. The role Ethernet plays in today’s
networks as well as what Media Access Control (MAC) addresses are and how they are used are
two more critical networking basics you’ll want a solid understanding of as well.

you’ll also learn about some very important Ethernet specifications.
I’ll review the types of cabling
used with Cisco devices in this chapter, demonstrate how to connect to a router or switch, plus
show you how to connect a router or switch via a console connection.

I’ll also introduce you to a vital process of encoding data as it makes its way down the OSI stack,
known as encapsulation.

Ethernet:
- Ethernet is a contention-based media access method that allows all hosts on a network to share
the same link’s bandwidth
- Praktis

Without employing VLANs in today’s switched environments, there
wouldn’t be much bandwidth available to individual users. Switches break up collision domains
with each port, which is awesome, but they’re still only one broadcast domain by default! It’s also
one more reason why it’s extremely important to design our networks very carefully

And key to carefully planning your network design is never to allow broadcast domains to grow
too large and get out of control. Both collision and broadcast domains can easily be controlled
with routers and VLANs, so there’s just no excuse to allow user bandwidth to slow to a painful
crawl when there are plenty of tools in your arsenal to prevent the suffering.

Ethernet networking uses a protocol called Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision
Detection (CSMA/CD), which helps devices share the bandwidth evenly while preventing two
devices from transmitting simultaneously on the same network medium

CSMA/CD was actually
created to overcome the problem of the collisions that occur when packets are transmitted from
different nodes at the same time. And trust me—good collision management is crucial, because
when a node transmits in a CSMA/CD network, all the other nodes on the network receive and
examine that transmission

You can use full-duplex Ethernet in at least the following six situations:
- switch to host
- switch to switch
- host to host
- switch to router
- router to router
- router to host

Last, remember these important points:
- There are no collisions in full-duplex mode.
- A dedicated switch port is required for each full-duplex node.
- The host network card and the switch port must be capable of operating in full-duplex mode.
- The default behavior of 10Base-T and 100Base-T hosts is 10 Mbps half-duplex if the
autodetect mechanism fails, so it is always good practice to set the speed and duplex of each
port on a switch if you can.

= Ethernet at the Data Link Layer =
Ethernet at the Data Link layer is responsible for Ethernet addressing, commonly referred to as
MAC or hardware addressing

Ethernet is also responsible for framing packets received from the
Network layer and preparing them for transmission on the local network through the Ethernet
contention-based media access method.

MAC Address terdiri dari 12 digit: 6 OUI dan 6 NIC
atau terdiri dari 6 byte yang setara dengan 48 bit

1 byte is 8 bits, bits mean a slot for 0 and 1. So, if you have 4 bits, u can represent a number from 0 to 15 
0 = 0000
15 = 1111

= Binary Values, Nibble, Hex =
10000000 = 128
11000000 = 192
11100000 = 224
11110000 = 240
11111000 = 248
11111100 = 252
11111110 = 254
11111111 = 255

Now suppose you have something like this: 0x6A. This is important because sometimes Cisco
likes to put 0x in front of characters so you know that they are a hex value. It doesn’t have any
other special meaning.

1 hex is 1 nibble consisted of 4 bit

ox6A: Six equals 0110, and A, which is 10 in hex, equals 1010, so the complete byte would
be 01101010.

To convert from binary to hex, just take the byte and break it into nibbles. Let me clarify this.
Say you have the binary number 01010101. First, break it into nibbles—0101 and 0101—with the
value of each nibble being 5 since the 1 and 4 bits are on. This makes the hex answer 0x55. And
in decimal format, the binary number is 01010101, which converts to 64 + 16 + 4 + 1 = 85.

= Ethernet Frames = 

The Data Link layer is responsible for combining bits into bytes and bytes into frames. Frames
are used at the Data Link layer to encapsulate packets handed down from the Network layer for
transmission on a type of media access.

Ethernet frame terdiri atas:
- Preamble 7 bytes
- SFD 1 byte
- Destination 6 bytes
- Source 6 bytes
- Type 2 bytes
- Data and Pad 46 - 1500 bytes
- FCS 4 bytes

note: Encapsulating a frame within a different type of frame is called tunneling.

note: jarak menjadi faktor penting ketika menentukan kabel network. diperlukan repeater untuk jarak yang jauh

kabel:
1. Category 5 Enhanced UTP cable
The category 5 Enhanced UTP cable can handle speeds up to a gigabit with a distance of up to
100 meters. Typically we’d use this cable for 100 Mbps and category 6 for a gigabit, but the
category 5 Enhanced is rated for gigabit speeds and category 6 is rated for 10 Gbps!

= Straight-Through Cable = 
is used to connect
- host to switch or hub
- router to switch or hub
4 wires are used in straight-through cable to connect ethernet devices

= Crossover Cable = 
is used to connect
- switch to switch
- hub to hub
- host to host
- hub to switch
- router direct to host
- router to router
dinamakan crossover karena pemasangan kabel pada pinnya ga 1 to 1, tapi cross

= UTP Gigabit Wiring (1000Base-T) =

Butuh 4 pasang (total 8 kabel)

= Rolled Cable =
