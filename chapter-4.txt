== Chapter 4: Easy Subnetting ==

Creating subnetworks is essentially the act of taking bits from the host portion of the address and
reserving them to define the subnet address instead. Clearly this will result in fewer bits being
available for defining your hosts, which is something you’ll always want to keep in mind.

class - default subnet
Class A: 255.0.0.0
Class B: 255.255.0.0
Class C: 255.255.255.0

= Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) =
It’s basically the method that Internet service providers (ISPs) use to allocate a number of
addresses to a company, a home—their customers.

When you receive a block of addresses from an ISP, what you get will look something like this:
192.168.10.32/28. This is telling you what your subnet mask is. The slash notation (/) means
how many bits are turned on (1s). Obviously, the maximum could only be /32 because a byte is 8
bits and there are 4 bytes in an IP address: (4 × 8 = 32)

Take, for example, a Class A default subnet mask, which is 255.0.0.0. This tells us that the first
byte of the subnet mask is all ones (1s), or 11111111. When referring to a slash notation, you need
to count all the 1 bits to figure out your mask. The 255.0.0.0 is considered a /8 because it has 8
bits that are 1s—that is, 8 bits that are turned on.

pendefinisian subnet mask x cidr value dimulai dari pangkat 2 terbesar dlu
255.0.0.0 -> /8
255.128.0.0 -> /9
255.192.0.0 -> /10
255.224.0.0 -> /11
255.240.0.0 -> /12
255.248.0.0 -> /13
255.252.0.0 -> /14
255.254.0.0 -> /15
255.255.0.0 -> /16
etc.

cuma bisa sampe slash /30 karena perlu ada host euy

/8 through /15 can only be used with class A; /16 through /23 class A&B; /24 through /30 class A,B,&C

pake first and last subnet. dia kayak nyediain 2 ekstra subnet

= Subnetting Class C address =
There are many different ways to subnet a network. The right way is the way that works best for
you. In a Class C address, only 8 bits are available for defining the hosts.
