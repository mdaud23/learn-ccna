== Chapter 4: Easy Subnetting ==

Creating subnetworks is essentially the act of taking bits from the host portion of the address and
reserving them to define the subnet address instead. Clearly this will result in fewer bits being
available for defining your hosts, which is something youâ€™ll always want to keep in mind.

class - default subnet
Class A: 255.0.0.0
Class B: 255.255.0.0
Class C: 255.255.255.0
